        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Faye-Peace Richardson, a first year Software engineering student. I love using web development to showcase my skills and express how passionate i am about technology and creating innovative solutions. Recently, I've developed a strong interest in AI, especially in how machine learning and natural language processing can enhance user experiences and automate complex tasks. I believe that combining my current univeristy specification with real world experience will bring me one step closer to my dream of creating and taking part in projects that have a meaningful impact on society that last generations.</p>
        <h3>Why Software Engineering?</h3>
        <p>I chose Software Engineering because it allows me to creatively solve problems while working with the latest technologies. I enjoy building user-friendly applications and websites that can help make a positive impact on others.</p>
        <p>No matter their age, people always have a special place in their hearts for the games and websites that bring back nostalgic memories. These digital experiences often leave a lasting impression, reminding us of simpler times while shaping our love for technology and design. I aim to create similar experiences that people will cherish and remember for years to come!</p>
